# BRAIN_TUMOR_DETECTION

Brain Tumor Detection Project using Python and its libraries involves the use of image processing techniques to detect tumors in MRI brain scans. The project involves loading the MRI scan images using libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy, and converting them to grayscale for better image processing. Image segmentation techniques such as thresholding, contouring, and morphological operations can be applied to identify the region of interest that contains the tumor. Machine learning algorithms such as SVM and Random Forest can be used to classify the tumor region from the non-tumor region. The project can be extended to create a user interface for doctors to input patient data and display the results of the tumor detection. This project can have significant applications in the medical field and can aid doctors in the early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.
